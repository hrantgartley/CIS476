1. An architecture can either inhibit or enable a system’s driving quality attributes.
2. The decisions made in an architecture allow you to reason about and manage
   change as the system evolves.
3. The analysis of an architecture enables early prediction of a system’s qualities.
4. A documented architecture enhances communication among stakeholders.
5. The architecture is a carrier of the earliest, and hence most fundamental,
   hardest-to-change design decisions.
6. An architecture defines a set of constraints on subsequent implementation.
7. The architecture dictates the structure of an organization, or vice versa.
8. An architecture can provide the basis for incremental development.
9. An architecture is the key artifact that allows the architect and the project
   manager to reason about cost and schedule.
10. An architecture can be created as a transferable, reusable model that forms
    the heart of a product line.
11. Architecture-based development focuses attention on the assembly of
    components, rather than simply on their creation.
12. By restricting design alternatives, architecture channels the creativity of
    developers, reducing design and system complexity.
13. An architecture can be the foundation for training of a new team member.

## Possible Quiz Question Topics

1. A system’s ability to meet its desired (or required) quality attributes is
   substantially determined by its architecture. If you remember nothing
   else from this book, remember that.
